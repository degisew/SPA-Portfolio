            I am Degisew, and I am a front-end web developer in love with
            creating beautiful and interactive UI. Currently, Iâ€™m enrolling
            at microverse, an online web development school to jump to
            full-stack development.

            I began my career by teaching IT courses
            in private colleges. My time as an instructor was very
            interesting because there were a lot of questions and answers
            and that really helped me to practice more and to stay updated
            with the technology. Last year, I developed an internship
            platform for my school by learning a new framework and I got
            recognition for this achievement. Currently, I am working on a
            project which is an online web development learning platform
            aimed to teach Ethiopian students in their native language.

            The one thing that makes me special is when I am working on a
            project, I give full focus and tend to be goal oriented till I
            finish it and I can take care of full responsibility to do it on
            my own self if it is necessary. I also have an experience in
            pair programming and can collaborate in remote work with any
            devs around the globe.
